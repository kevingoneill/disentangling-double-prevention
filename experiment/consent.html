<p align="left"><strong>Purpose:</strong> This research study seeks to help us understand the ways in which our experiences inform our causal judgments.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>What you will be asked to do:</strong> This research study consists of one session. You will be asked to play a short game where you split a sum of money, and then answer a few questions about the game you played. You will also be asked for your demographic information. The total time for participating in this research study is expected to take between 2 and 10 minutes. You will be paid at a prorated rate of $14/hour. Participation in this study is voluntary, and you can stop at any time without penalty, but you will only receive any bonus payments if you complete the study. </p>

All data will be securely saved at all times. All data we keep will be de-identified, indefinitely.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Future Use of Data:</strong> Your de-identified data (data without your name), together with de-identified data from other participants in the experiment, might be made publicly available, will be shared with other researchers as a requirement of publication and funding, and might be used for future research purposes.</p>
